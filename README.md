# Final-Project-Transforming-and-Analyzing-Data-with-SQL

## Project/Goals
The goal of this project for me was to get a better understanding and polish up my skills in SQL as I felt like I knew nothing approaching this project. This project will help me have more practice in terms of creating my own steps in how to approach certain SQL questions and apply the knowledge I had gaine through lectures and compass to this project.

## Process
### STEP 1: Was to understand the dataset given to me. This is done through analyzing the multiple tables (5 tables) and see if there any correlation between each other. An example of this were to find columns that were present in multiple tables, just to know if there are tables I can join together to get a better understanding of the data.
### STEP 2: My next step in my process for completing this project was to only use data columns/tables that were necessary and useful. Some columns were just clutter and hindered how I view the tables. This were done through data cleaning. Also data transforming were done at this step, as this was needed in order to answer those questions.

## Results
I had discovered that there were some formatting discrepancies and also a lot of null values that needed to be cleaned. Cleaning the data using the WHERE clause and also CASE statements where necessary to provide the correct format and filter out all the null values.

## Challenges 
Some challenges that I had faced while working on this project was intially had trouble exporting the dataset into pgAdmin. There were multiple ways on how to do this, however it seemed like the way I exported the tables had some problems. For example, this whole project took me longer to do because when SELECTING a specific column name I would have to use quotation marks (""). Another challenge i faced with this project was understanding what the questions were asking. Finding values for each city and country were time consumming. But after I got guidance from a mentor, it really helped me starting answering those questions in the right track.

## Future Goals
If I had more time, I would ask more questions. We were required to answer 3-5 questions however, due to the lack of time I only had enought time to do 3 questions. Doing 5 questions would probably help me understand the data even more.
