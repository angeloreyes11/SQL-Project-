**What issues will you address by cleaning the data?**

**Cleaning Process**

During the cleaning process of the different tables, I initially noticed right away that there were alot of null values, improper formatting, and irrelavent columns. I tackled this task as I went through the questions from "starting_with_data" and "starting_with_questions". As I worked through those questions, there were some columns that had to be cleaned up along the way. In the section below, I will list down what neccesary changes I had to do in order to help me get through and undertand those questions. Note that some columns were not used and had to be dropped. Creating views were the choice of action while performing the cleaning process as it was advised not to touch the actual data. 

Queries:
Below, provide the SQL queries you used to clean your data.

_**Table 1: "all_sessions" table.**_

There were plenty of issues with the all_seasons table. Since this was the main table to use in order for me to answer the questions provided for this project, there were a lot of data cleaning that had to be done.
